# Development Plan: Video-Integrated Note-Taking Platform

## Overview
This project aims to create a structured, user-friendly system for organizing and annotating video-based content. The platform will allow users to embed videos, take notes with timestamp links, capture video screenshots, and use AI-generated summaries to enhance their learning and research experience.

## Target Users
- Students and educators utilizing video content for learning.
- Researchers and professionals who need to document video insights.
- Anyone looking for a better way to bookmark and organize video-based knowledge.

## Core Features
### 1. Note-Taking System with Interactive Cards
- Users create **cards**, similar to digital notes, where they can embed videos and take notes.
- Cards are displayed in a **grid view**, providing easy access and previews.
- Users can **group cards** by dragging one on top of another and naming the group.
- A **modal popup** displays group contents while keeping the rest of the screen visible.
- Cards can be **removed from a group** by dragging them out.
- Users can **filter and search** through their cards with tags and keywords.

### 2. Video Embedding & Timestamp Integration
- Users **embed videos** from external links like YouTube.
- Notes can include **timestamp links** formatted as `#MM:SS#`, allowing users to jump to specific moments in the video.
- A **timestamp button** below the video inserts the current timestamp at the cursor position or at the end of the note.

### 3. Screenshot Capture from Video
- Users can **capture a screenshot** of the video at the current timestamp.
- The screenshot is inserted into the note as an image at the cursor position or at the end of the note.
- The capture button is **disabled when the video is not playing** to ensure relevant snapshots.

### 4. AI-Powered Summarization
- Users can generate **AI-based summaries** of the video transcript with a button click.
- If a transcript is available, the AI processes it and displays the summary below the video.
- The summary remains **editable** for user customization.

### 5. Data Management & Sharing
- By default, all notes are **private**.
- Users can **generate public links** to share read-only versions of specific notes.
- Cards can be **exported and imported** in JSON format, allowing users to back up and transfer their data.

### 6. Auto-Save & Version Tracking
- All edits are **automatically saved** after **2 seconds of inactivity**.
- A **rotating cloud icon** next to the note title indicates active saving.
- Once saved, a status message displays **"Last saved X seconds ago."**

## User Experience & Interface Principles
- **Minimalist design** to keep the interface clean and distraction-free.
- **Smooth interactions** ensuring real-time feedback and responsiveness.
- **Inline editing** to allow users to edit notes directly without opening separate windows.
- **Seamless video and note-taking experience**, keeping everything on one screen.

## Security & Access Control
- **User authentication** via email/password and Google login.
- **Private-first approach**, ensuring that notes remain confidential unless explicitly shared.
- **Access control measures** to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Rate-limiting and data validation** to enhance security and prevent spam or abuse.

## Development Plan & Rollout
1. **Build Core Features** – Implement note-taking, video embedding, and timestamping.
2. **Enhance Functionality** – Add AI-powered summaries, screenshot capture, and card grouping.
3. **Enable Sharing & Data Portability** – Develop JSON import/export and sharing options.
4. **Improve User Interface** – Refine design, add animations, and optimize workflow.
5. **Beta Testing & Refinement** – Launch for early users and gather feedback for improvements.
